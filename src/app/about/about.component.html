        <p>This project is aimed at developing an employee attendance system for organizations. The system uses modern technologies to streamline the attendance recording process.</p>
        <p>Employees can check in and check out using various methods such as biometric scanners, mobile applications, or web portals.</p>
        <p>The system also includes features for employee registration and management, allowing contractors to easily onboard and manage their workforce.</p>
        <p>With advanced reporting and analytics, organizations can gain insights into employee attendance patterns, helping them optimize resource allocation and improve efficiency.</p>
        <p>This project is built using Angular for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.</p>
